# kaggle_bnp_paribas
This is a kaggle competition analysis done by Adam Li and Roy Hu. Two individuals from California and interested in data science. The prompt that we are trying to answer is at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management.

Background:
As a global specialist in personal insurance, BNP Paribas Cardif serves 90 million clients in 36 countries across Europe, Asia and Latin America.

In this challenge, BNP Paribas Cardif is providing an anonymized database with two categories of claims:
* claims for which approval could be accelerated leading to faster payments
* claims for which additional information is required before approval

Kagglers are challenged to predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers.

What We Do?
Using IPython, R and Matlab, we will analyze the dataset. Our hope is to not implement the "fanciest" algorithm, but explore the data as true data scientists in this fashion of questions:
* descriptive
* exploratory
* inferential
* predictive
* causal
* mechanistic

epicycles of analysis:
1) question
2) collect data
3) eda
4) model building
5) interpret
6) communication
